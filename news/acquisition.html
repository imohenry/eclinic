                 AGOS, Nigeria - Interswitch Limited, a leading technology-driven company focused on the digitization of payments in Nigeria and other African countries, has announced the acquisition of eClat Healthcare Limited, 
                    a Nigeria-based health technology company that aims to improve healthcare delivery in Africa. 
                    The deal was completed on September 30, 2019, and it involves Interswitch acquiring a 60% stake in eClat through the purchase of shares from current shareholders and subscription to new shares issued by the company.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="text-section">
                <p class="norm-text">
                    Founded in 2012, eClat Healthcare Limited specializes in assisting healthcare service providers in planning, designing, and operating their unique practices through the deployment of its bespoke healthcare technology platform, designed specifically for the healthcare environment in Africa. 
                    eClat's healthcare technology platform consists of a core e-Clinic software (including electronic billing, immunization, ante-natal, and care pathway functions), as well as a variety of additional specialist modules. 
                    Prior to the acquisition, eClat's platform had become a leading Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform used in over 250 public and private healthcare facilities in Nigeria.

                <p class="norm-text">
                    Nigeria's healthcare system currently lacks adequate funding and a national framework, leading to operational inefficiencies. 
                    Interswitch's strategic investment in healthcare technology aims to address these challenges by modernizing the healthcare sector in Nigeria and eventually in Africa through its innovative products and services. 
                    They are trying to base off their medical set up on the <a href="https://whitesandstreatment.com/locations/florida/tampa/" class="white-sands"><strong>White Sands Alcohol & Drug Rehab</strong> </a>facility as they have proven to be successful with their services. 
                    The combined product offerings of Interswitch and eClat are expected to, amongst other things, enable operators in the healthcare sector to develop new capabilities, improve the efficiency of their core operations and facilitate seamless payments.

                <p class="norm-text">
                    Due to the growing adoption of Interswitch's healthcare product offerings by the operators, Interswitch's healthcare technology platform aims to be one of the top industry platforms in Nigeria, 
                    which can be utilized as a major data source by healthcare policymakers for planning and efficiency improvements in the sector.

                    As a result of this acquisition, the combined healthcare technology solutions are expected to position the Interswitch group as a health-tech solution and payments provider of choice to the healthcare industry going forward.

                “We are a technology company that is innovating to deliver value across sectors that are critical to Africa's social and economic development, 
                our acquisition of eClat demonstrates strong progress along with this strategy and alignment with our corporate vision.

                    Healthcare is rapidly evolving towards new, integrated, and scalable models of care delivery that put the consumer at the center. 
                    At the core of Interswitch's expansion into healthcare is our ambition to provide customers with greater access to healthcare across different interaction points beyond hospitals, 
                    such as at pharmacies and primary health care facilities, providing much-needed services to patients across Nigeria and, in the future, in Africa.

                    Also remarking on the acquisition, Dr. Wallace Ogufere, co-founder/CEO of eClat Healthcare Limited stated “The growing adoption of value-based care, combined with the increasing level of usage of patient portals across the industry, 
                    has made it critical to take a new approach to patient engagement solution design in Nigeria. We expect to tightly integrate the eClat capabilities into the Interswitch platform, adding functionality that would enable providers to reach their entire patient populations by leveraging existing patient contact information”.

                    In 2016, Interswitch acquired the mobile financial services player, VANSO. Interswitch had earlier closed the acquisition of Paynet Group in February 2015 in a deal that resulted in the creation of a combined network of over 100 financial institutions, deepening Interswitch’s footprint in East Africa. Interswitch intends to continue with its expansion strategy whilst refining its offering, creating innovative payment solutions that are tailored to the demands of the African market.
