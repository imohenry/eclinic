                The e-clinic software is the backbone of the ePHC healthcare solution. 
                It's a purposed-designed four-point technology solution for clinics, designed to move primary health centers from fragmented pen and paper records (or lack of records) to creating detailed digital patient records that can be analyzed through a central database to improve the quality of healthcare and availability of resources such as drugs and personnel. The versatility of the software makes it a useful tool for a range of care providers from the trained nurse to a specialized doctor. The software is largely designed to allow nurses to treat patients instead of clinics needing experienced doctors. The software makes diagnosis easier and treatment safer.

                Our approach has helped overcome many of the problems that hindered other similar projects from being successful. 
                No reliance on fluctuating electricity supply from the national grid - solar to the rescue; No dependence on the Internet to work - a rich and mature architecture based on LAN (wired and wireless) and above all, all benefits of EHR in a single software.

                To ensure buy-in from all stakeholders and build our competitive advantage as a brand, we improve not just administration but the workflow and operations of doctors, nurses, and community health workers. We provide extensive information that helps guide diagnoses - 
                a benefit we call “the invisible helper” - and we empower them to manage their caseload by scheduling appointments and follow-ups (instead of dealing with peaks and troughs of normal outpatient wards).
